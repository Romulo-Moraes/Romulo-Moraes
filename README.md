<h1>Hello, i'm Rômulo <mark> "Cypher" </mark> Moraes 👋</h1>


Hello, my name is Rômulo Peres de Moraes but my nickname is Cipher, i just guess this name canny, you know. i'm a computer enthusiast and my focus in
this area is to learn as close as possible the exactly of how the computer works. I like video games, skateboarding and listen music. Currently my
favorite programming language is C, for me there is no thing more powerful than it.

<h1>Some good repositories that you would like</h1>

<h2>Assembly-Toolkit ⚙️</h2>
Assembly-Tool kit is a framework for low level programming made when i was learning this type of tool, but i still 
developing it today too. This project has some code segments that implement some C standard functions, to goal of
speed and simplicity, supporting currently only x86 and x64 instructions set, for Nasm assembler.
-->

<h2>R-matrix 💻</h2>
This is a program for terminal written in Rust that simulate a matrix on screen, it is costumizable, characters
and background color can be changed to another colors and operations speeds is costumizable too. This project already 
existed written in C programming language, however, was used by me to learn a bit more about Rust.

<h2>R-clock 🕐</h2>
This is a program that show a digital clock in terminal screen, and it has some costumizations
like change clock color and date color, allowing you to make the clock shorter too, by just not showing the seconds,
useful to put in a small terminal window like a i3wm, etc...

<h2>Holiday 🏖️</h2>
Holiday is a lightweight argument parser written in C for C programming language that allow you accept optional
and positional arguments, both of them with some salt, like make optional argument required, short optional argument name like
"-n foo" instead of "--name bar" is available too. This library try not break the good ways, to deal with this, the code,
functions, macros and types is separated by files ".c" and ".h". The project's README.md explain much better how to use it.
